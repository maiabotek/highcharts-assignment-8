  <p> Over the course of the last three years, current events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and a looming economic recession have affected peopleâ€™s income.  According to <a href =https://fortune.com/2022/09/13/median-household-income-2021/> Fortune</a>, Americans have faced record-breaking inflation, with incomes being somewhat stagnant.  This data will illustrate what changes in median household income have taken place over time in the selected counties, as well as the rate of individuals below the poverty line. </p>

  <p> The 10 Florida counties selected share similar population sizes, according to the <a href= "https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/florida-population-change-between-census-decade.html"> U.S. Census</a>, and all data was collected between 2016 and 2020.  As the economic situation, whether a recession or growth, changes in the United States, it is important to pay attention to key metrics that share information about both households and individuals. </p>
